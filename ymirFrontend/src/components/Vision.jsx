                <p className="text-gray-400">The principle is simple. Every time our partners buy mining equipment, we tokenize it under the form of an SFT (semi-fungible token) that corresponds to an ownership contract between you and the mining company. This SFT is 100% owned by you, and thus you can trade it on our marketplace. After receiving your SFT, you can activate it on your farm through our website and start earning mining rewards directly in your bitcoin wallet. </p>

            <p className="text-gray-400">Our main goal is to decentralize bitcoin mining, make it more sustainable and accessible to everyone through mining collocation. Our system makes mining accessible to small retail investors through the tokenization of computing power. You no longer need to worry about technicalities, electricity costs, noise, heat, reparations, etc. Everything is taken care of by our teams of professionals. We require our partners to have 100% green energy sources to push bitcoin mining in the right direction. Buying your equipment with us will guarantee you green bitcoins and a healthier planet. </p>
